  abstract = {Topological invariants have proved useful for analyzing emergent function as they characterize a property of the entire system, and are insensitive to local details, disorder, and noise. They support edge states, which reduce the system response to a lower dimensional space and offer a mechanism for the emergence of global cycles within a large phase space. Topological invariants have been heavily studied in quantum electronic systems and been observed in other classical platforms such as mechanical lattices. However, this framework largely describes equilibrium systems within an ordered crystalline lattice, whereas biological systems are often strongly non-equilibrium with stochastic components. We review recent developments in topological states in discrete stochastic models in 1d and 2d systems, and initial progress in identifying testable signature of topological states in molecular systems and ecology. These models further provide simple principles for targeted dynamics in synthetic systems or in the engineering of reconfigurable materials. Lastly, we describe novel theoretical properties of these systems such as the necessity for non-Hermiticity in permitting edge states, as well as new analytical tools to reveal these properties. The emerging developments shed light on fundamental principles for non-equilibrium systems and topological protection enabling robust biological function.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY                            Life on earth is subject to daily and predictable fluctuations in light intensity, temperature, and humidity created by rotation of the earth. Circadian rhythms, generated by a circadian clock, control temporal programs of cellular physiology to facilitate adaptation to daily environmental changes. Circadian rhythms are nearly ubiquitous and are found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Here we introduce the molecular mechanism of the circadian clock in the model cyanobacterium               Synechococcus elongatus               PCC 7942. We review the current understanding of the cyanobacterial clock, emphasizing recent work that has generated a more comprehensive understanding of how the circadian oscillator becomes synchronized with the external environment and how information from the oscillator is transmitted to generate rhythms of biological activity. These results have changed how we think about the clock, shifting away from a linear model to one in which the clock is viewed as an interactive network of multifunctional components that are integrated into the context of the cell in order to pace and reset the oscillator. We conclude with a discussion of how this basic timekeeping mechanism differs in other cyanobacterial species and how information gleaned from work in cyanobacteria can be translated to understanding rhythmic phenomena in other prokaryotic systems.},

  abstract = {While Hermiticity lies at the heart of quantum mechanics, recent experimental advances in controlling dissipation have brought about unprecedented flexibility in engineering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in open classical and quantum systems. Examples include parity-time-symmetric optical systems with gain and loss, dissipative Bose-Einstein condensates, exciton-polariton systems, and biological networks. A particular interest centers on the topological properties of non-Hermitian systems, which exhibit unique phases with no Hermitian counterparts. However, no systematic understanding in analogy with the periodic table of topological insulators and superconductors has been achieved. In this paper, we develop a coherent framework of topological phases of non-Hermitian systems. After elucidating the physical meaning and the mathematical definition of non-Hermitian topological phases, we start with one-dimensional lattices, which exhibit topological phases with no Hermitian counterparts and are found to be characterized by an integer topological winding number even with no symmetry constraint, reminiscent of the quantum-Hall insulator in Hermitian systems. A system with a nonzero winding number, which is experimentally measurable from the wave-packet dynamics, is shown to be robust against disorder, a phenomenon observed in the Hatano-Nelson model with asymmetric hopping amplitudes. We also unveil a novel bulk-edge correspondence that features an infinite number of (quasi)edge modes. We then apply the ùêæ theory to systematically classify all the non-Hermitian topological phases in the Altland-Zirnbauer (AZ) classes in all dimensions. The obtained periodic table unifies time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries, leading to highly nontrivial predictions such as the absence of non-Hermitian topological phases in two dimensions. We provide concrete examples for all the nontrivial non-Hermitian AZ classes in zero and one dimensions. In particular, we identify a ‚Ñ§2 topological index for arbitrary quantum channels (completely positive trace-preserving maps). Our work lays the cornerstone for a unified understanding of the role of topology in non-Hermitian systems.},

  abstract = {The Escherichia coli chemotaxis signaling pathway has served as a model system for the adaptive sensing of environmental signals by large protein complexes. The chemoreceptors control the kinase activity of CheA in response to the extracellular ligand concentration and adapt across a wide concentration range by undergoing methylation and demethylation. Methylation shifts the kinase response curve by orders of magnitude in ligand concentration while incurring a much smaller change in the ligand binding curve. Here, we show that the disproportionate shift in binding and kinase response is inconsistent with equilibrium allosteric models. To resolve this inconsistency, we present a nonequilibrium allosteric model that explicitly includes the dissipative reaction cycles driven by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. The model successfully explains all existing joint measurements of ligand binding, receptor conformation, and kinase activity for both aspartate and serine receptors. Our results suggest that the receptor complex acts as an enzyme: Receptor methylation modulates the ON-state kinetics of the kinase (e.g., phosphorylation rate), while ligand binding controls the equilibrium balance between kinase ON/OFF states. Furthermore, sufficient energy dissipation is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the sensitivity range and amplitude of the kinase response. We demonstrate that the nonequilibrium allosteric model is broadly applicable to other sensor-kinase systems by successfully fitting previously unexplained data from the DosP bacterial oxygen-sensing system. Overall, this work provides a nonequilibrium physics perspective on cooperative sensing by large protein complexes and opens up research directions for understanding their microscopic mechanisms through simultaneous measurements and modeling of ligand binding and downstream responses.},

As two applications, we study convection cycles arising under the PageRank algorithm and we investigate chiral edge flows for a stochastic model of a bimonomer's configuration dynamics. Our experiments highlight how system parameters‚Äîe.g., the teleportation rate for PageRank and the transition rates of external and internal state changes for a monomer‚Äîcan act as homology regularizers of convection, which we summarize with persistence barcodes and homological bifurcation diagrams. Our approach establishes a connection between the study of convection cycles and homology, the branch of mathematics that formally studies cycles, which has diverse potential applications throughout the sciences and engineering.},

We describe the evolution of the allostery concept, from a conformational change in a two-state model (1965, 1966) to dynamic allostery in the ensemble model (1999); from multi-subunit (1965) proteins to all proteins (2004). We highlight the current available methods to study allostery and their applications in studies of conformational mechanisms, disease, and allosteric drug discovery. We outline the challenges and future directions that we foresee.

  abstract = {The molecular biology revolution of the last seventy five years has transformed our view of living systems. Scientific explanations of biological phenomena are now synonymous with the identification of the genes, proteins, and signaling molecules involved. The hegemony of the molecular paradigm has only become more pronounced as new technologies allow us to make measurements at scale. Combining this wealth of data with new ``artificial intelligence'' techniques is viewed as the future of biology. Here, we challenge this emerging ``common sense'', laying out a roadmap for developing a theoretical understanding of life. We argue that a twenty-first century theoretical biology must be founded on a new type of statistical physics suited to the living world. Rather than merely constructing statistical models, a statistical theory requires developing ``quantitative abstractions'' for understanding the gene-organism-environment triad. This necessitates overcoming four major challenges that distinguish living matter: (1) living systems are composed of a large number of heterogeneous parts rather than a large number of identical objects; (2) living systems control and manipulate the physical world in a manner that is extremely different from the ways considered in traditional statistical physics; (3) living systems necessarily operate out of equilibrium; (4) living systems are evolved objects with a function, resulting in new types of constraints that must be imposed on probabilistic ensembles. We conclude by discussing a few key themes that we view as promising directions for developing a statistical physics of life: typicality, localized biological control, a linear response of complex systems with non-reciprocal interactions, biological resource allocation, and learning and adaptation in overparameterized systems.},

  abstract = {Stochastic effects in biomolecular systems have now been recognized as a major physiologically and evolutionarily important factor in the development and function of many living organisms. Nevertheless, they are often thought of as providing only moderate refinements to the behaviors otherwise predicted by the classical deterministic system description. In this work we show by using both analytical and numerical investigation that at least in one ubiquitous class of (bio)chemical-reaction mechanisms, enzymatic futile cycles, the external noise may induce a bistable oscillatory (dynamic switching) behavior that is both quantitatively and qualitatively different from what is predicted or possible deterministically. We further demonstrate that the noise required to produce these distinct properties can itself be caused by a set of auxiliary chemical reactions, making it feasible for biological systems of sufficient complexity to generate such behavior internally. This new stochastic dynamics then serves to confer additional functional modalities on the enzymatic futile cycle mechanism that include stochastic amplification and signaling, the characteristics of which could be controlled by both the type and parameters of the driving noise. Hence, such noise-induced phenomena may, among other roles, potentially offer a novel type of control mechanism in pathways that contain these cycles and the like units. In particular, observations of endogenous or externally driven noise-induced dynamics in regulatory networks may thus provide additional insight into their topology, structure, and kinetics.},

  abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation‚Äìdissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

  abstract = {Life has adapted to Earth's~day-night cycle with the evolution of endogenous biological clocks. Whereas these circadian rhythms typically involve extensive transcription-translation feedback in higher organisms, cyanobacteria have a circadian clock, which functions primarily as a protein-based post-translational oscillator. Known as the Kai system, it consists of three proteins KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. In this chapter, we provide a detailed structural overview of the Kai components and how they interact to produce circadian rhythms of global gene expression in cyanobacterial cells. We discuss how the circadian oscillation is coupled to gene expression, intertwined with transcription-translation feedback mechanisms, and entrained by input from the environment. We discuss the use of mathematical models and summarize insights into the cyanobacterial circadian clock from theoretical studies. The molecular details of the Kai system are well documented for the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, but many less understood varieties of the Kai system exist across the highly diverse phylum of Cyanobacteria. Several species contain multiple kai-gene copies, while others like marine Prochlorococcus strains have a reduced kaiBC-only system, lacking kaiA. We highlight recent findings on the genomic distribution of kai genes in Bacteria and Archaea and finally discuss hypotheses on the evolution of the Kai system.},

  abstract = {Self-propulsion is a quintessential aspect of biological systems, which can induce nonequilibrium phenomena that have no counterparts in passive systems. Motivated by biophysical interest together with recent advances in experimental techniques, active matter has been a rapidly developing field in physics. Meanwhile, over the past few decades, topology has played a crucial role to understand certain robust properties appearing in condensed matter systems. For instance, the nontrivial topology of band structures leads to the notion of topological insulators, where one can find robust gapless edge modes protected by the bulk band topology. We here review recent progress in an interdisciplinary area of research at the intersection of these two fields. Specifically, we give brief introductions to active matter and band topology in Hermitian systems, and then explain how the notion of band topology can be extended to nonequilibrium (and thus non-Hermitian) systems including active matter. We review recent studies that have demonstrated the intimate connections between active matter and topological materials, where exotic topological phenomena that are unfeasible in passive systems have been found. A possible extension of the band topology to nonlinear systems is also briefly discussed. Active matter can thus provide an ideal playground to explore topological phenomena in qualitatively new realms beyond conservative linear systems.},

In the last century and a half, a fair number of approaches have been developed to meet this aim. This study of their foundations assesses their coherence and analyzes the motivations for their basic assumptions, and the interpretations of their central concepts. The most outstanding foundational problems are the explanation of time-asymmetry in thermal behaviour, the relative autonomy of thermal phenomena from their microscopic underpinning, and the meaning of probability.},

  abstract = {Long and stable timescales are often observed in complex biochemical networks, such as in emergent oscillations. How these robust dynamics persist remains unclear, given the many stochastic reactions and shorter time scales demonstrated by underlying components. We propose a topological model that produces long oscillations around the network boundary, reducing the system dynamics to a lower-dimensional current in a robust manner. Using this to model KaiC, which regulates the circadian rhythm in cyanobacteria, we compare the coherence of oscillations to that in other KaiC models. Our topological model localizes currents on the system edge, with an efficient regime of simultaneously increased precision and decreased cost. Further, we introduce a new predictor of coherence from the analysis of spectral gaps, and show that our model saturates a global thermodynamic bound. Our work presents a new mechanism and parsimonious description for robust emergent oscillations in complex biological networks.},
