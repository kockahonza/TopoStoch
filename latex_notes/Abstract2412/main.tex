	% General introduction to topology in biology/biophysics - 98 words
	Despite noisiness in the cellular environment, molecular systems show a high degree of robustness.
	A recent new direction in understanding this apparent paradox is the study of topologically protected states in stochastic systems, which robustly confine the dynamics of the system to a lower dimensional space\cite{muruganTopologicallyProtectedModes2017,tangTopologyProtectsChiral2021,soneHermitianNonHermitianTopology2024}.
    However, it is unclear what the minimal biochemical ingredients are for such states to occur.
	% Getting into the project - ~110 words
    Here we study topological features in a non-equilibrium, thermodynamically consistent model of a molecular assembly, subunits of which undergo futile cycles of conformational change and phosphorylation.
    % Such futile cycles are common in biological settings\cite{sharmaFutileCyclesEmerging2024,samoilovStochasticAmplificationSignaling2005} and can give rise to topological edge currents\cite{tangTopologyProtectsChiral2021}.
    When the subunits allosterically interact with each other we find global cycles at the scale of the assembly, analogous to topological edge currents in quantum systems.
    We map out the kinetics, energetics, and biochemical interactions necessary to obtain distinct classes of topological behaviour.

    % Results-ish ->
    %     it is a very nice and elegant model
    %     it shows that complicated biological mechanisms may not always be necessary
    Our results suggest that topological states provide a more minimal/succinct description of molecular systems showing robust oscillations such as circadian clock (e.g. KaiABC, microt).
    Our results suggest that topological states provide a more minimal/succinct description of coordination in molecular assemblies such as circadian oscillators (e.g. KaiABC).

    More generally our framework suggest that stereotyped behaviour may be a result of non-equilibrium drive only.
    
    % Upon joining the subunits with a nearest-neighbor interaction however, the small futile cycles fall apart, and we look for open of closed directed currents in the overall assembly dynamics (\cref{fig:onlyfigure}).
    % Such closed loops in the macroscopic dynamics could help understand highly robust, out-of-equilibrium systems such as the KaiABC molecular clock\cite{zhengTopologicalMechanismRobust2024} or \ldots.

    % Bit of a conclusion

    % Kinda want to somehow make it clear we don't just aritificially impose them here

	% Getting on to "results" - 83
	% We find that even without explicitly favouring futile cycles in the assembly, adding an energy cost to having a boundary between different conformations results in directed probability currents in the steady state.
	% If both this energy cost and the ATP concentration are large then we get a connected current loop as in \cref{fig:onlyfigure} corresponding to the macroscale equivalent of the futile cycle.
	% If either is reduced, this loops breaks in one place and the current is transferred along a diffuse network through the gap.

% 	% General introduction to topology in biology/biophysics - 84 words
% 	Stochastic systems are key to many areas of biophysics as much of living matter takes place in a highly noisy environment.
% 	However, despite this noisiness, many biological systems show a high degree or robustness.
% 	A recent new direction in understanding this apparent paradox is the study of topology of stochastic systems\cite{muruganTopologicallyProtectedModes2017,tangTopologyProtectsChiral2021,soneHermitianNonHermitianTopology2024,zhengTopologicalMechanismRobust2024}.
% 	Topological states can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the configurational space and thus can explain robustness without making specific assumptions about the mechanics of a system, while themselves being robust to local changes.
%
% 	% Getting into the project - ~110 words
% 	In this study we look for topological features in a non-equilibrium, thermodynamically consistent stochastic model of an allosteric assembly where each unit can change conformation and (de)phosphorylate.
% 	The system is driven out of equilibrium by the inclusion of two different phosphorylation reactions: a direct reaction by (de)binding a phosphate group and one driven by ATP to ADP conversion.
% 	We allow these to couple differently depending on subunit conformation as this is to only way for an isolated subunit to favour undergoing a futile cycle of phosphorylating, changing conformation, dephosphorylating and changing conformation back.
% 	Such futile cycles are common in biological settings\cite{sharmaFutileCyclesEmerging2024,samoilovStochasticAmplificationSignaling2005} and give rise to topological currents when imposed artificially\cite{tangTopologyProtectsChiral2021}.

\section{New Notes}
\subsection{Questions and things to discuss}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Title! Right now it is very clunky. Should it include "thermodynamically consistent"?
    \item Conclusion bit! Very much not sure about it as it is -- is it too short? Should I specifically cite the paper I do there as that really proposes a similar but different model for it, or should I instead highlight the locality difference we add to it? Not sure
    \item In order to expand the conclusion I need to slightly cut down something.
	\item Should I reference the figure from the abstract?
	\item Little Things \begin{itemize}
		      \item Should I explicitly list what our futile cycle is? It's a bit long and perhaps obvious but I think it's nice to give a concrete, simple thing to visualize.
              \item I should probably check that using "artificially" where I do is appropriate.
              \item "this robustness" $\rightarrow$ "biological robustness"?
              \item Is "We consider" acceptable language?
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{General}
\begin{itemize}
	\item So going for \textbf{Clocks, timers and cell cycle dynamics} topic
	\item Can I squeeze in "non-Hermitian topology" somewhere (I have some references for it, and it is relevant)?
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{Old Notes}
\paragraph{Format}
For POL2025 (the one due on the 6th) it should be 250 words, include references and up to 1 figure.
\paragraph{Topic}
I need to choose one of a list of topics.
Perhaps the closest might be: \textbf{"Biomolecular assemblies and condensates"} given that the main model is of an allosteric assembly?
Others that may be relevant:
\begin{itemize}
	\item "Patterns, waves, transport, collective phenomena, and microswimmers" -- there's collective phenomena! but idk about microswimmers
	\item "Clocks, timers and cell cycle dynamics" -- if we lean into KaiABC then maybe
	\item "Protein structure, dynamics and interactions" -- cause I guess the polymer as I've been calling it would realistically be a protein?
	\item "Emerging Areas in the Physics of Life" -- idk what this is but probably not
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Approach to talk about a project that has only just started?
	\item Should I be talking about allostery or not so much? It seems relevant and as an interesting topic but it's not really a core ingredient in it.
	\item I'm a bit worried that the only "result" is a bit obvious once you think about it. If we add a penalty for NN having different conformation then of course the ones with all the same conformation will be preferred. Then if all are in conformation 1 (tense) then they are ATP driven to bind ligands so they do so. After that they are by our choice of parameters not favoured to debind hence the only thing they can do is change conformation. The same sort of reasoning then completes the cycle.
	\item Is an ArXiV citation admissible here?\cite{soneHermitianNonHermitianTopology2024}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key points to cover}
\begin{itemize}
	\item stochastic systems
	\item futile cycles
	\item non-equilibrium dynamics
	\item allostery
	\item system features
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item complex -- high dimensional network, not pen-and-paper tractable
		      \item locality -- unlike the previous models, have NNs, can model waves along the polymer
		      \item discrete configurational space
		      \item Thermodynamically consistent? idk if this is the right wording
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Search for topological states/patterns in realistic systems (this means starting from the ground up with (non-equilibrium) statphys, LDB, no arbitrary choices) with futile cycles
	\item the futile cycle is implemented via physical parameters by coupling to two physically reasonable asymmetrical processes
\end{itemize}
