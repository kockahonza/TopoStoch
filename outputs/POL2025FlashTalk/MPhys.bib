  abstract = {Two-dimensional simulations of the coarsening process of the isotropic/smectic-A phase transition are presented using a high-order Landau–de Gennes-type free energy model. Defect annihilation laws for smectic disclinations, elementary dislocations and total dislocation content are determined. The computed evolution of the orientational correlation length and disclination density is found to be in agreement with previous experimental observations showing that disclination interactions dominate the coarsening process. The mechanism of smectic disclination movement, limited by the absorption and emission of elementary dislocations, is found to be facilitated by curvature walls connecting interacting disclinations. At intermediate times in the coarsening process, split-core dislocation formation and interactions displaying an effective disclination quadrupole configuration are observed. This work provides the framework for further understanding of the formation and dynamics of the diverse set of curvature defects observed in smectic liquid crystals and other layered material systems.},

This model is formulated with three position-dependent order parameters, namely the reduced translational density, the local nematic order parameter, and the mean local direction of the orientations. The equilibrium free-energy functional involves local powers of the order parameters up to fourth order, gradients of the order parameters up to fourth order, and different couplings between the order parameters. The stable phases of the equilibrium free-energy functional are calculated for various coupling parameters. Among the stable liquid-crystalline states are the isotropic, nematic, columnar, smectic A, and plastic crystalline phases. The plastic crystals can have triangular, square, and honeycomb lattices and exhibit orientational patterns with a complex topology involving a sublattice with topological defects. Phase diagrams were obtained by numerical minimization of the free-energy functional. Their main features are qualitatively in line with much simpler one-mode approximations for the order parameters.},

We use a time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg approach where the smectic ordering is described by the complex order parameter ψ(→r,t)=ηeiϕ. This quantity allows both the degree of layering and the position of the layers to be monitored. We are able to follow both precollision and postcollision regimes, and distinguish different early and late behaviors within these regimes. The early precollision regime is driven by changes in the ϕ(→r) configuration. The relative velocity of the defects is approximately inversely proportional to the interdefect separation distance. In the late precollision regime the symmetry changes within the cores of defects also become influential. Following the defect collision, in the early postcollision stage, bulk layer order is approached exponentially in time. At very late times, however, there seems to be a long-time power-law tail in the order parameter fluctuation relaxation.},

We consider various orientations of the surface field and compute domain growth laws and scaling functions. In the absence of any anchoring field we find that (and in contrast to a confined binary liquid mixture) mere confinement of the liquid crystals is insufficient to produce slow growth of the nematic domains owing to the vector nature of the order parameter. In the presence of a strong homogeneous anchoring, the system quickly reaches a nematic state. On the other hand, for homeotropic anchoring, the liquid crystal takes on an XY character and the growth law exponent crosses over from 1/2 to 1/4 as the field strength is increased. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

The power-law tail is shown to be associated with topological defects in the field, and its amplitude is calculated exactly in terms of the defect density. For a conserved vector order parameter the multiscaling form obtained for n = ∞ is argued to be special to this limit. Using an approximate theory due to Mazenko, it is shown that conventional scaling is recovered, for any finite n, when t→∞, with L(t)∼ (tln n)14 for n large.},

We argue that the problem can be understood in terms of the lack of rotational Goldstone modes in such systems and provide an alternate approach that correctly accounts for the interaction between translations and rotations. Dislocations are associated, as usual, with branch points in a phase field, whereas disclinations arise as critical points and singularities in the phase field. We introduce a three-dimensional model for two-dimensional smectics that clarifies the topology of disclinations and geometrically captures known results without the need to add compatibility conditions. Our work suggests natural generalizations of the two-dimensional smectic theory to higher dimensions and to crystals.},

  abstract = {The fourth-order PDE that models the density variation of smectic A liquid crystals presents unique challenges in its (numerical) analysis beyond more common fourth-order operators, such as the classical biharmonic. While the operator is positive definite, the equation has a "wrong-sign" shift, making it somewhat more akin to an indefinite Helmholtz operator, with lowest-energy modes consisting of plane waves. As a result, for large shifts, the natural continuity, coercivity, and inf-sup constants degrade considerably, impacting standard error estimates. In this paper, we analyze and compare three finite-element formulations for such PDEs, based on \$H\^{}2\$-conforming elements, the \$C\^{}0\$ interior penalty method, and a mixed finite-element formulation that explicitly introduces approximations to the gradient of the solution and a Lagrange multiplier. The conforming method is simple but is impractical to apply in three dimensions; the interior-penalty method works well in two and three dimensions but has lower-order convergence and (in preliminary experiments) seems difficult to precondition; the mixed method uses more degrees of freedom, but works well in both two and three dimensions, and is amenable to monolithic multigrid preconditioning. Our analysis reveals different behaviours of the error bounds with the shift parameter and mesh size for the different schemes. Numerical results verify the finite-element convergence for all discretizations, and illustrate the trade-offs between the three schemes.},

  abstract = {Dispersing colloidal particles into liquid crystals provides a promising avenue to build a novel class of materials, with potential applications, among others, as photonic crystals, biosensors, metamaterials and new generation liquid crystal devices. Understanding the physics and dynamical properties of such composite materials is then of high-technological relevance; it also provides a remarkable challenge from a fundamental science point of view due to the intricacies of the hydrodynamic equations governing their dynamical evolution. Here, we provide an overview of our current theoretical understanding of the dynamical and hydrodynamic properties of colloid–liquid crystal composites, focussing on the results obtained from computer simulations; no or very limited previous knowledge of the field of liquid crystals is assumed. While our main emphasis is on the dynamics, we also review a selection of equilibrium results and simulations to provide the necessary background. We start by describing what we know about the simplest possible problem: that of a single particle in a nematic, or cholesteric, liquid crystal. We then consider two particles, and review the conditions which lead to the formation of a dimer; we then again focus on dynamical problems. Finally, we turn to the more complicated case of a dispersion, reviewing here simulations motivated by optical tweezer and rheological experiments. We close by making a list of some of the many open problems in this rapidly developing research field.},

Of particular interest are the formation and evolution of ordered patterns composed of active particles that exhibit collective behavior. Here we examine such a type of nonpotential active system, focusing on effects of coupling and competition between chiral particle self-propulsion and self-spinning. It leads to the transition between three bulk dynamical regimes dominated by collective translative motion, spinning-induced structural arrest, and dynamical frustration. In addition, a persistently dynamical state of self-rotating crystallites is identified as a result of a localized-delocalized transition induced by the crystal-melt interface. The mechanism for the breaking of localized bulk states can also be utilized to achieve self-shearing or self-flow of active crystalline layers.},

  abstract = {While many scientists are familiar with fractals, fewer are familiar with scale-invariance and universality which underlie the ubiquity of their shapes. These properties may emerge from the collective behaviour of simple fundamental constituents, and are studied using statistical field theories. Initial chapters connect the particulate perspective developed in the companion volume, to the coarse grained statistical fields studied here. Based on lectures taught by Professor Kardar at MIT, this textbook demonstrates how such theories are formulated and studied. Perturbation theory, exact solutions, renormalization groups, and other tools are employed to demonstrate the emergence of scale invariance and universality, and the non-equilibrium dynamics of interfaces and directed paths in random media are discussed. Ideal for advanced graduate courses in statistical physics, it contains an integrated set of problems, with solutions to selected problems at the end of the book and a complete set available to lecturers at www.cambridge.org/9780521873413.},

  abstract = {Curvature is an important concept for understanding layering structures in soft matters, ranging from complex macromolecular self-assembled structures to simple lipid bilayers. Among the various kinds of soft matters, smectic liquid crystal (LC) phases have been widely studied because of their periodic featured curvatures under various external forces. Generally, their curvatures are on the micron-scale due to the bulk elasticity of smectic LC materials. In this review, a combination of sublimation and recondensation of smectic LC materials generates a variety of curvatures at the nanometer scale, which cannot be achieved by self-assembly under thermal equilibrium conditions. In particular, we have focused on the change of curvatures in focal conic domains under non-equilibrium conditions, in which negative and zero Gaussian curvatures in the micron-scale transform to positive Gaussian curvatures in the micron- and nanometer scales. Finally, the review closes with applications using such non-equilibrium self-assembly of smectics.},

Since then, chiral smectic phases and their plethora of polar effects have dominated the research in this field, which today has reached a mature state where the first commercial microdisplay applications are now shipping in millions-per-year quantities. In this Review we discuss some of the topics of highest interest in current smectic liquid crystal research, and address application-relevant research (de Vries-type tilting transitions without defect generation and high-tilt antiferroelectric liquid crystals with perfect dark state) as well as more curiosity-driven research (the nature and origin of the chiral smectic C subphases and their intermediate frustrated states between ferro- and antiferroelectricity).},

  abstract = {Liquid crystals constitute a fascinating class of soft condensed matter characterized by the counterintuitive combination of fluidity and long-range order. Today they are best known for their exceptionally successful application in flat panel displays, but they actually exhibit a plethora of unique and attractive properties that offer tremendous potential for fundamental science as well as innovative applications well beyond the realm of displays. Today this full breadth of the liquid crystalline state of matter is becoming increasingly recognized and numerous new and exciting lines of research are being opened up. We review this exciting development, focusing primarily on the physics aspects of the new research thrusts, in which liquid crystals – thermotropic as well as lyotropic – often meet other types of soft matter, such as polymers and colloidal nano- or microparticle dispersions. Because the field is of large interest also for researchers without a liquid crystal background we begin with a concise introduction to the liquid crystalline state of matter and the key concepts of the research field. We then discuss a selection of promising new directions, starting with liquid crystals for organic electronics, followed by nanotemplating and nanoparticle organization using liquid crystals, liquid crystal colloids (where the liquid crystal can constitute either the continuous phase or the disperse phase, as droplets or shells) and their potential in e.g. photonics and metamaterials, liquid crystal-functionalized polymer fibers, liquid crystal elastomer actuators, ending with a brief overview of activities focusing on liquid crystals in biology, food science and pharmacology.},

  abstract = {Using angular momentum representation a method is proposed that allows the systematic construction of a generalized Landau-de Gennes elastic free energy of liquid crystals, in powers of a symmetric and traceless tensor order parameter, polarization field, of external fields and all respective derivatives. By this method all linearly independent elastic invariants and surface terms are constructed for nematics and cholesterics up to fourth order terms. In particular it is shown that up to fourth order in the tensor order parameter there are nineteen bulk elastic constants and four surface terms in the free energy of a general, biaxial nematic. In addition, the stability of this expansion is studied in detail. Some special cases of the elastic free energy of liquid crystals, already discussed in the literature, are reexamined and discrepancies with our results are emphasized. Finally, a thermo-dynamically correct way of establishing contact between the generalized de Gennes elastic free energy and other theories, like those of Oseen-Frank or Meyer, is proposed by applying fluctuation theory. Thus, the degeneracy of splay and bend elastic constants is removed even when these are calculated from the standard de Gennes free energy. Restrictions on higher order elastic constants are also obtained by comparing mean field relations and stability conditions with available experimental data.},

  abstract = {Liquid crystals are considered as gases of long barlike molecules. Variables describing the position and orientation of individual molecules are introduced. These are used to arrive at a microscopic definition of the order in liquid crystals in terms of a symmetric traceless tensor. The Frank and Leslie-Ericksen directors are shown to be equivalent to the unit eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of this symmetric traceless tensor. Attention is then restricted to nematics. It is shown that the Frank free energy gives a valid description of equilibrium properties of nematics to order χaH2ρκTm−1, where χa is the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility, H the external magnetic field, ρ the mass density, T the temperature, k the Boltzmann constant, and m the molecular mass. Microscopic justification is given for the linearized Leslie-Ericksen hydrodynamic theory for nematics. A microscopic response-function description of nematics is then presented, and contact is made between the general frequency- and wave-number-dependent response functions and those calculated from the phenomenological hydrodynamic theory. Applications to light scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance are considered. 1T1 calculated here differs from that calculated from the Pincus theory by a factor of S2, where S is the parameter measuring the degree of nematic order.},

This book is the first to be concerned solely with biaxial nematic liquid crystals, both lyotropic and thermotropic, formed by low molar mass as well as polymeric systems. It opens with a general introduction to the biaxial nematic phase and covers: • Order parameters and distribution functions • Molecular field theory • Theories for hard biaxial particles • Computer simulation of biaxial nematics • Alignment of the phase • Display applications • Characterisation and identification • Lyotropic, thermotropic and colloidal systems together with material design With a consistent, coherent and pedagogical approach, this book brings together theory, simulations and experimental studies; it includes contributions from some of the leading figures in the field.

In a formal idealization, this charge is distributed in pointlike units of quarter-integer magnitude, which we identify with tetratic disclinations located at the end points and nodes. This coexisting nematic and tetratic order is analyzed with the help of extensive Monte Carlo simulations for a broad range of two-dimensional confining geometries as well as colloidal experiments, showing how the observed defect networks can be universally reconstructed from simple building blocks. We further find that the curvature of the confining wall determines the anchoring behavior of grain boundaries, such that the number of nodes in the emerging networks and the location of their end points can be tuned by changing the number and smoothness of corners, respectively.},

Starting from an initially randomly perturbed isotropic phase, several types of topological defects are spontaneously formed, and then annihilate during a coarsening process until a steady state is achieved. The coarsening process is highly complex involving several scaling laws of defect densities as a function of time where different dynamical exponents can be identified. In general the exponent for the final stage towards the steady state is significantly larger than that in the passive and in the planar case, i.e., the coarsening is getting accelerated both by activity and by the topological and geometrical properties of the sphere. A defect type characteristic for this active system is a rotating spiral of evolving smectic layering lines. On a sphere this defect type also determines the steady state. Our results can in principle be confirmed by dense systems of synthetic or biological active particles.},

The book examines lamellar (smectic) and columnar liquid crystals, which, in addition to orientational order, possess 1D, 2D or 3D positional order. This volume illustrates original physical concepts using methodically numerous experiments, theoretical developments, and diagrams. Topics include rheology and plasticity, ferroelectricity, analogies with superconductors, hexatic order and 2D-melting, equilibrium shapes, facetting, and the Mullins-Sekerka instability, as well as phase transitions in free films and membrane vibrations. Nematic and cholesteric liquid crystals are covered by the authors in a separate volume entitled Nematic and Cholesteric Liquid Crystals: Concepts and Physical Properties Illustrated by Experiments. Smectic and Columnar Liquid Crystals is an ideal introduction and a valuable source of reference for theoretical and experimental studies of advanced students and researchers in liquid crystals, condensed matter physics, and materials science.},

  abstract = {Matter self-assembling into layers generates unique properties, including structures of stacked surfaces, directed transport, and compact area maximization that can be highly functionalized in biology and technology. Smectics represent the paradigm of such lamellar materials — they are a state between fluids and solids, characterized by both orientational and partial positional ordering in one layering direction, making them notoriously difficult to model, particularly in confining geometries. We propose a complex tensor order parameter to describe the local degree of lamellar ordering, layer displacement and orientation of the layers for simple, lamellar smectics. The theory accounts for both dislocations and disclinations, by regularizing singularities within defect cores and so remaining continuous everywhere. The ability to describe disclinations and dislocation allows this theory to simulate arrested configurations and inclusion-induced local ordering. This tensorial theory for simple smectics considerably simplifies numerics, facilitating studies on the mesoscopic structure of topologically complex systems.},

  abstract = {A Modern Course in Statistical Physics is a textbook that illustrates the foundations of equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics, and the universal nature of thermodynamic processes, from the point of view of contemporary research problems. The book treats such diverse topics as the microscopic theory of critical phenomena, superfluid dynamics, quantum conductance, light scattering, transport processes, and dissipative structures, all in the framework of the foundations of statistical physics and thermodynamics. It shows the quantum origins of problems in classical statistical physics. One focus of the book is fluctuations that occur due to the discrete nature of matter, a topic of growing importance for nanometer scale physics and biophysics. Another focus concerns classical and quantum phase transitions, in both monatomic and mixed particle systems.This fourth edition extends the range of topics considered to include, for example, entropic forces, electrochemical processes in biological systems and batteries, adsorption processes in biological systems, diamagnetism, the theory of Bose-Einstein condensation, memory effects in Brownian motion, the hydrodynamics of binary mixtures.A set of exercises and problems is to be found at the end of each chapter and, in addition, solutions to a subset of the problems is provided. The appendices cover Exact Differentials, Ergodicity, Number Representation, Scattering Theory, and also a short course on Probability.},

  abstract = {High quality flow kinematics reconstruction from noisy and spatially scattered data requires the use of regularization techniques but remains a challenge. We set out to test the effect and practical relevance of additional incompressibility constraints. To this end, we present two methods for reconstructing smooth velocity and velocity gradient fields from such data in an incompressible two-dimensional complex flow. One is based on a generalized Tikhonov regularization combined with a finite element approximation and uses a stream function formulation, which enforces incompressibility (hard constraint). This approach is compared to that in which incompressibility is asymptotically achieved by adding a divergence penalty term in the regularization expression (soft constraint). The methods are compared on synthetic velocity data, obtained for an incompressible Oldroyd–B fluid in a cross-slot channel with added noise. For such data sets, both methods are seen to lead to essentially identical results. However, for a given grid size, the stream function formulation uses a single regularization parameter and less degrees of freedom to provide the required continuity of the gradient fields. The fidelity of the reconstruction is investigated in terms of the quality of the streamlines and velocity gradient history. Incompressibility constraints turn into significant and valuable improvement for applications as we demonstrate by analyzing the stress and optical signal fields obtained by applying a constitutive equation to the reconstructed flow fields.},

The symmetric position of the heterocyclic group in the centre of the liquid crystal, bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)4,4-(1,3,4-oxadiazole-2,5-diyl)dicarboxylate, yields a very rigid and non-linear mesogenic core. Despite this non-linear structure, a broad liquid crystalline range with a smectic C and a smectic A phase was found. Conoscopic experiments on freely suspended films revealed the existence of two optical axes in the smectic A phase, indicating a phase symmetry anticipated for either a 'McMillan' biaxial smectic phase or a biaxial (achiral) ferroelectric smectic phase.},

The threshold voltage will increase with increasing of frequency. SMT fluctuation occurs when V SMT continues to increase at the same frequency. This phenomenon can be analized by applying an image processing tecnique. Based on image feature extraction method, inhomogeneity of SMT patterns can be observed through contrast, correlation, energy, homogeneity, and entropy parameters. Those parameters represent a result in accordance with the image visualization. Significant changes in the value of contrast, energy, homogeneity, and entropy parameters occur at V {$>$} V SMT which fluctuation begin. In this experiment the fluctuation begin at V = 27.3 V.}

  abstract = {Most field theories for active matter neglect effects of memory and inertia. However, recent experiments have found inertial delay to be important for the motion of self-propelled particles. A major challenge in the theoretical description of these effects, which makes the application of standard methods very difficult, is the fact that orientable particles have both translational and orientational degrees of freedom which do not necessarily relax on the same time scale. In this work, we derive the general mathematical form of a field theory for soft matter systems with two different time scales. This allows to obtain a phase field crystal model for active particles with translational and orientational memory. Notably, this theory is of third order in temporal derivatives and can thus be seen as a spatiotemporal jerky dynamics. We obtain the phase diagram of this model, which shows that, unlike in the passive case, the linear stability of the liquid state depends on the damping coefficients. Moreover, we investigate sound waves in active matter. It is found that, in active fluids, there are two different mechanisms for sound propagation. For certain parameter values and sufficiently high frequencies, sound mediated by polarization waves experiences less damping than usual passive sound mediated by pressure waves of the same frequency. By combining the different modes, acoustic frequency filters based on active fluids could be realized.},

Simply and easily written, with an emphasis on the applications of this calculus, it has long been a standard reference of physicists, engineers, and applied mathematicians. The author begins slowly, introducing the reader to the calculus of variations, and supplying lists of essential formulae and derivations. Later chapters cover isoperimetric problems, geometrical optics, Fermat's principle, dynamics of particles, the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue-eigenfunction problem, the theory of elasticity, quantum mechanics, and electrostatics. Each chapter ends with a series of exercises which should prove very useful in determining whether the material in that chapter has been thoroughly grasped.The clarity of exposition makes this book easily accessible to anyone who has mastered first-year calculus with some exposure to ordinary differential equations. Physicists and engineers who find variational methods evasive at times will find this book particularly helpful. "I regard this as a very useful book which I shall refer to frequently in the future."

To validate our proposed model, we conduct a series of two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments that account for typical structures in smectics: chevron patterns, defects, dislocations and toroidal focal conic domains (TFCDs). These results also reveal the phenomenological differences between smA and smC configurations.},
